Software engineers and technical writers produce such documentation during regular product development lifecycles. The documentation can also be recreated after the fact via reverse engineering. The {DMM} has both process and product components; this paper focuses on the product quality aspects.},

Documentation has long been prominent on the list of recommended practices to improve development and help maintenance. Recently however, agile methods started to shake this view, arguing that the goal of the game is to produce software and that documentation is only useful as long as it helps to reach this {goal.On} the other hand, in the re-engineering field, people wish they could re-document useful legacy software so that they may continue maintain them or migrate them to new {platform.In} these two case, a crucial question arises: {"How} much documentation is enough?" In this article, we present the results of a survey of software maintainers to try to establish what documentation artifacts are the most useful to them.},

One of the goals of this survey was to uncover the perceived relevance (or lack thereof) of software documentation, and the tools and technologies used to maintain, verify and validate such documents. The survey results highlight the preferences for and aversions against software documentation tools. Participants agree that documentation tools should seek to better extract knowledge from core resources. These resources include the system's source code, test code and changes to both. Resulting technologies could then help reduce the effort required for documentation maintenance, something that is shown to rarely occur. Our data reports compelling evidence that software professionals value technologies that improve automation of the documentation process, as well as facilitating its maintenance.},
